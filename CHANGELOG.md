# Changelog

All notable changes to Anki Design are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is semver-ish.

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- **The reviewer's card area fills the window.** It used to be capped at
  a reading measure (Settings → Reviewer → Card width — 780px at Medium).
  That's a good rule for prose and a bad one for everything else: a
  seven-column table, a wide diagram or a screenshot got squeezed into
  that column in the middle of a wide window and then, because the card
  area scrolls, was cut off on *both* sides. Cards of every shape now use
  the full window minus the page gutter and grow as you resize it. Images
  scale to the available width, preformatted text wraps, and wide tables
  shrink to fit rather than scrolling. Settings → Reviewer → Card width
  no longer sizes the card area. The Browse preview pane follows the same
  rules, fitted to the pane instead of the window.

### Added
- **The Browse tab now looks like the rest of the app.** The card table,
  column headers, sidebar tree, search bar, splitters and scrollbars are
  painted from the same palette as the deck list — paper background,
  hairline rules, flat uppercase column labels, a quiet accent wash for
  the selected row, and no Qt button gradients anywhere. Switch off with
  **browse_restyle**.
- **A rendered card preview in the Browse tab.** The right-hand pane is
  now a vertical split: the selected card drawn exactly as the reviewer
  draws it (note-type CSS, cloze holes, images, MathJax, your reviewer
  typography settings) on top, the fields underneath. Click the card, or
  the Question / Answer switch, to flip sides; it follows the row
  selection as you arrow through the table. Switch off with
  **browse_render_preview**.
- **A trimmed Browse sidebar.** Decks and Tags — the two real ways a
  collection is grouped — and nothing else. Saved Searches, Today, Flags,
  Card State and Note Types are hidden; every one of them was a search
  you can still type (`is:due`, `flag:1`, `added:1`, `note:Basic`).
  Section headings are set as headings, not as rows. Switch off with
  **browse_sidebar_minimal**.
- The Browse editor pane gets the Add window's editor styling (shared
  stylesheet, with pane-specific spacing). Switch off with
  **restyle_browse_editor**.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-02
### Fixed
- Sub-decks now open the way you left them. The deck list reads Anki's own
  per-deck collapse flag (the one that syncs), and the chevrons write it
  back — so decks you minimised stay minimised after a restart instead of
  everything expanding on launch. The old behaviour is still available as
  **Sub-decks on startup: Expanded**; there is also **Collapsed**.
- Single-deck home page: a lone top-level deck (e.g. `All::…`) hid all of
  its sub-decks behind the hero card. They now list underneath it, with
  their own chevrons and gears. The hero itself can be switched off.
- Turning the sidebar off left the deck list empty (the tree payload was
  only injected alongside the sidebar).
- Inline rename works again on the redesigned deck rows (it had fallen
  back to Anki's rename prompt after the shared-list refactor).
- The "Show streak counter" setting is wired up; it was a no-op.

### Added
- Move decks without renaming: drag a deck onto another deck to nest it,
  drop it on the top-level zone to un-nest it, or pick **Move to…** from
  the deck's gear menu for a searchable list of destinations. Both drive
  Anki's own reparent operation.
- Settings → **Appearance → Background**: Paper / White / custom colour
  for light mode and Ink / Black / custom for dark mode.
- Settings → **Reviewer → Style card content** — off keeps your note
  type's own CSS (fonts, colours, background) exactly as stock Anki
  renders it; the header and answer keys stay.
- Settings → **Reviewer → Answer buttons** — interval chips (default) or
  Anki's labelled Again / Hard / Good / Easy bar.
- Every opinionated feature now has its own switch, all defaulting to the
  current behaviour: today panel, click-to-reveal, press feedback, inline
  editing, click-a-deck-to-study (vs. Anki's overview page), drag-to-move,
  the command palette, inline Add / Browse / Stats / Preferences windows,
  the redesigned Add window, the redesigned finished-deck page, and quiet
  sync. `config.md` documents each key.
- "Restore Anki Design defaults" now reads the shipped `config.json`, so
  it can never drift from the real defaults.

### Changed
- Default for sub-decks on startup is **Remember** (Anki's synced state)
  rather than always expanded.
- Settings page regrouped into Appearance · Home page · Deck list ·
  Reviewer · Windows · Heatmap · Typography.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-24
### Added
- Cmd-K command palette: searches actions, decks, cards, and tags from
  anywhere (deck browser, overview, reviewer). Opens via the sidebar's
  "Search anything…" pill, ⌘K / Ctrl-K, or Cmd-Shift-P.
- Press-feedback animation on ease grading — soft radial bloom expands
  from the pressed key and the interval text fades in place.
- Redesigned congrats page (deck-finished): editorial header, single-
  sentence result, proportional accuracy bar with legend.
- Shared deck-list component: the home tree and the congrats "keep going"
  list render through the same module (`web/decklist.{js,css}`).
- `min_point_version: 250900` in `manifest.json` so older Ankis don't try
  to install a build they can't run.

### Fixed
- Ease-interval chips (`10 min`, `1 day`, etc.) now appear on Image
  Occlusion, Cloze, and any non-FrontSide card types — previously they
  only showed up when the back template included `{{FrontSide}}`.
- Deck-browser single-deck mode no longer renders the deck twice (the
  shared deck-list bails when the hero card owns the page).
- "Search anything…" pill renders with its background and border on the
  congrats page; Anki's Svelte/Bootstrap reset was wiping them.
- "Try custom study" link no longer duplicates on the congrats page when
  there are no other decks with work due.

## [0.1.0]
Initial AnkiWeb release.
### Added
- Base theme injected into the deck browser, overview, and reviewer.
- Contribution-style review-activity heatmap on the deck list, with
  today / streak / total summary.
- Reviewer progress bar with a `done / total` label.
- Themed Add Card, Browse, Stats, Preferences windows.
- Inline rename and a custom deck-options menu on multi-deck rows.
- Inline field editing in the reviewer (in place of the EditCurrent dialog).
- Config: `accent`, `show_heatmap`, `show_progress`, `heatmap_weeks`,
  `theme`, `density`, `sidebar_nav`, `heatmap_palette`,
  `reviewer_card_width`, `reviewer_font_size`, `font_serif`, `font_sans`.
- Declares conflicts with Onigiri, Review Heatmap, and the Progress Bar
  add-on so Anki warns users instead of silently fighting them.

### Known issues
- Anki 25.09's deck-list DOM differs from the classic selectors; some rows
  are low-contrast until the theme selectors are tuned.
- Qt chrome (menus, native dialogs, sidebar) is not themed yet.
