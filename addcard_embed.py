"""Anki Design — embed AddCards inside the main window as a "tab".

Anki opens AddCards as a separate QMainWindow. The user wants it to behave
like a tab in the main window: the sidebar (rendered inside `mw.web` by the
deck browser HTML) stays visible, and the editor occupies the rest.

How this works:
  - There is no left-nav rail item for Add — it lives inside Browse (its
    own "+ Add" button, `browse_embed._open_add_in_browse`, which calls
    `open_inline(mw)` below). `__init__.py`'s `_open_add` — what the "A"
    shortcut and `mw.onAddCard` are patched to call — routes through that
    same path so it opens Browse with the Add panel already stacked on
    top, rather than calling `open_inline(mw)` directly.
  - `open_inline` constructs an AddCards instance (which fires our normal
    `_redress` via `add_cards_did_init`).
  - We grab its `centralWidget` and reparent it onto a thin overlay frame
    placed on top of `mw.form.centralwidget`, offset by the sidebar's
    width so the sidebar in mw.web stays visible through the gap.
  - The AddCards window itself is hidden (its widgets are alive, so all
    handlers, shortcuts, and add-on hooks continue to fire).
  - A small "← Back to decks" affordance in the top-left of the overlay
    closes AddCards and removes the overlay.
  - The overlay resizes with the main window via an installed event filter.

Caveats:
  - Sidebar width is hard-coded to 250px to match `web/sidebar.css`. If
    the sidebar changes width, this needs to be updated.
  - Qt widgets stacking above QWebEngineView on macOS Qt6 has been stable
    for a long time but is technically a known-fragile combination — if
    rendering glitches appear, fall back to the standard windowed flow.
